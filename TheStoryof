<q class="bigq"> In nature, <span class="good"> Good </span> & Evil do not exist. <br> The Universe itself is neither <span class="good"> good </span> nor <span class="bad"> bad </span>, but a potential in permanent development. </q>



<ul>
   <li>In life, there are 4 types of people.</li>
<li>  - People who think the Internet is <span class="good"> good </span> </li> 
<li>  - People who think the Internet is evil, </li> 
<li>  - People who think the Internet is cats, </li> 
<li>  - People who don't think about it.</li>

<p> Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. 
   <br>
Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue. <br>

Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
 <br> Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. <br>
 That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. 
 <br>
 That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. <br>
 If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. <br> If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that way.
  Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.<br> </p>

<p>They’re proofs to that.<br> Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. <br> 
Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.
 <br> But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. <br>
 Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

<p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. <br>
   They said, <q class= "qv"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.  </q> <br>
   The farmer said,<q class="qf"> Is it <span class="good"> goood </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? I don't know.” </q> <br>
  The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
   <q class="qv"> Oh, isn’t that lucky.
    What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses! </q> <br> The farmer again said,<q class="qf">Is it <span class="good"> goood </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? I don't know.
</q><br>
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. <br>
 The neighbors then said,<q class="qv"> Oh dear, that’s too bad, </q> and the farmer responded, <q class="qf"> Is it <span class="good"> goood </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? 
  I don't know. <br> </q>
 The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
 Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="qv">Isn’t that great! </q> <br> Again, he said, <q class="qf">Is it <span class="good"> goood </span>? Is it <span class="bad"> bad </span>? I don't know.
</q>
The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, 
 and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good"> good </span> or <span class="bad"> bad </span> —  <br> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; 
 or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good"> good </span> fortune.
